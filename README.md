TomographySoftwareDiploma
=========================
Introduction
 
This software package is an attempt to create a modern computational software for tomographic studies. The complex consists
of two parts. The first part - a demonstration of the filtered back-projection method with respect to the transmission of
computer tomography. User can simulate the sinogram ( graphical representations of the projection data ) and restore
them tomography using various digital and color filters . Second part - a proetsionnyh for data recovery for 
subsequent analysis. The program also directly interacts with the database in which the projection data and fall 
after receiving them. At the moment, there is no hardware component of the project and therefore used in the complex work 
of the scanner emulator . In complex integrated developed density analyzer which is designed to quantify the spectrum 
density of the sample.
The project was carried out as a thesis at the Department of Applied 's Nuclear Physics MEPhI . The project is fully open
and free , anyone can freely use it at their discretion under opensource license and change without fear.
